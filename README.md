# NUST-Library-Management-System
NUST Library Management System is a project which aims in developing a computerised system to maintain all the daily work of the Namibian University of Science and Technology’s library.

Designed by NUST’s Computer Science students _Rejoice Amutenya, Kuzavi Murangi, Gift Liswaniso and Natangwe Lubaki_ for the course _Programming 2 (PRG621S)_. The system is made using the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

**Aim:** To design a software that manages all the functions of a library, the NUST library to be specific as it will make it easier to track the students. 

**We have three main actors in our system:**

**1.	Librarian/ staff**: Mainly responsible for adding and modifying books, book items, and users. The Librarian can also issue, reserve, and return book items.

**2.	Student/Member**: All members can search the catalog, as well as check-out, reserve, renew, and return a book. 

**3.	System**: Mainly responsible for sending notifications for overdue books, canceled reservations, etc.
